"""
Minimal inference API for CardioFusion-AI fusion models.

Run with: uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

IMPORTANT: this repo does not ship a trained model checkpoint (see
PRODUCTION_READINESS.md -- no real cardiovascular-risk dataset has been
trained on yet). On startup, this API tries to load a checkpoint from
CARDIOFUSION_MODEL_PATH (or ./checkpoints/best_model.pt). If none is found,
the API still starts (so /health works for container orchestration) but
/predict returns HTTP 503 with a clear message rather than silently
returning meaningless output from an untrained/random-initialized network.
That's a deliberate design choice: a fake-looking prediction from an
untrained model is worse than an honest "not ready" response.
