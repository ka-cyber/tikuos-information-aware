"""
Figure 2-4 generation (manuscript Part 11 of task spec).

Figure 2: Test MAE vs. graded degradation severity (ECG-axis and PPG-axis
    panels), partner modality held clean, error bars = SD across 5 seeds.
Figure 3: Test MAE by degradation regime, grouped bars for representative
    fusion strategies.
Figure 4: Mean learned gate weight on ECG vs. PPG, by degradation regime,
    for the implicit and SQI-conditioned gates.

Pure matplotlib/pandas -- fully executable (see tests/test_figures.py,
which renders each figure to a temp file and checks it was created without
error). All data is read from upstream CSVs; nothing is hardcoded.

NOTE: Figure 2 requires per-severity-level (not just per-regime) MAE, which
needs raw per-window predictions broken out by (ecg_level, ppg_level), not
just the six collapsed regimes used in Table II / seed_results.csv. See
DISCREPANCIES.md item D8 for how this additional granularity is captured
(an extended results file, `severity_grid_results.csv`) and
train_loop.py/reproduce_all.py for how it's populated once training can
actually run.
